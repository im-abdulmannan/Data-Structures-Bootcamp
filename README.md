# Data Structures Bootcamp

**LeetCode 100-problem playlist** that starts with basic problems and gradually advances through data structures and algorithms (DSA). The problems are grouped by topic, progressing from beginner to advanced levels.

- Start with the easiest problems to build confidence.  
- Focus on learning how different problems are solved instead of trying to solve everything on your own.  
- Spend no more than 1 hour on a problem at first. If it takes longer, set it aside to revisit later.  
- Aim to solve problems in 30-45 minutes on average to practice speed and efficiency.  
- Solve 5-10 problems per topic instead of doing too many from the same area.  
- Make sure you learn the basics before solving problems. For example:  
  - Study HashSet/HashMap before solving problems that need them.  
  - Learn recursion before solving problems using recursion.  
  - Understand graphs and trees before working on those topics.  
  - Learn dynamic programming before tackling related problems.
